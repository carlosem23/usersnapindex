It is absolutely possible to change the email address of a team member. Unfortunately one can not change the email address directly from the dashboard due to security reasons. 
It needs to be handled as a replacement with a new account.
More explanations can be found in the Team managment.

{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "gl = canvas.getContext(\"experimental-webgl\", {preserveDrawingBuffer: true});",

}
[/block]
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Does Usersnap support iframes in feedback screenshots?"
}
[/block]
Yes, our widget supports displaying an embedded page, loaded in an iframe, as long as both web pages have the same origin.
Due to browser limitations, we won’t display content that loads from a different origin. A placeholder ‘Cross-Origin content’ will be displayed instead.
Our browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox) however do not have this restriction.

{
  "title": "Can confidential parts of screenshots and screen recording be hidden?"
}
[/block]
You can count on us! Privacy is important. We implemented a PII feature for you.
You can define elements that are automatically hidden on every screenshot or video (payment details etc). 
Additionally, you can activate the hide-feature for your users so that they can hide information for your team.
More importantly, the contents of that container will not even be transmitted to our rendering engine.
To always hide elements in your web application or website, let your developers apply this CSS class "usprivacy".

  "title": "Is Usersnap WCAG compliant?"
}

We are committed to improving our SaaS product to be more perceivable and operable to a wider range of people with disabilities. 
To integrate it successfully into your product, we propose 2 possible implementations:


Install the Usersnap code snippet on your application and set display rules to trigger by API log event.


Link to the full-page feedback form. In the project dashboard, find the “Share” button to get the link to a full-page feedback form. Copy the link and use it on your websites, emails and/or applications. 
[block:api-header]

Please note the Quick Issue Reporting widget upon spawning will announce to screen readers, using aria-live, that pressing the Enter key takes a screenshot. 
[block:api-header]

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Is Usersnap affected by the log4j vulnerability?"
}
[/block]
No, our investigations showed that Usersnap is not susceptible to the log4j vulnerability. 
The Usersnap backend is not built on Java or any other JVM language, so our main application does not (and cannot) use log4j.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Does Usersnap support Subresource Integrity (SRI)"
}
[/block]
No. 
We are a fast-moving company, that deploys improvements and new features on an almost daily basis.
Furthermore, some of our assets are dynamically generated – based on the configuration you choose in our dashboard.
It is possible to calculate the resource hashes on your own. 
However, they will most likely change too often to make this a feasible approach.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "How long is the data retained with Usersnap?"

1. Automatic deletion: 71 days after a paid subscription expires. It's also valid for the trial accounts.
2. Manual deletion: After users delete their account or feedback items, the data will be deleted immediately and is retained in backups for up to 31 days. Note that Usersnap will NOT recover data deleted.

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Can I hire your service to only process our data without keeping any of it?"
